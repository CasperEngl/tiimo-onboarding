## Project Details

This project is a Next.js application that uses Tailwind CSS for styling and [React Joyride](https://react-joyride.com/) for onboarding.

The application consists of three main pages: Home, Details, and Settings. These pages were designed using components from [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) to demonstrate the onboarding experience.
